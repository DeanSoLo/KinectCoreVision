**KinectCoreVision** is a refurnished version of the well know track application [CommunityCoreVision](http://ccv.nuigroup.com/) to use a KinectSensor.

This version of CCV was original designed for a light and portable setup of [Communitas multiTouch](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2010/communitas/) Table for IEATAÂ´s 9th International Conference (more info and videos about it). But it was lot of potencial.
